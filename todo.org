** TODO looks like (modulo) doesn't work - report upstream
[[file:~/timer/main.rkt::define seconds (floor (/ (- dist (* 60000 minutes)) 1000))]]
** DONE support count up from 0 to the time
CLOSED: [2021-11-10 Wed 00:38]
(students with extra time need this)
** TODO play sound when timer ends
** TODO configure the timer with UI
- click on number to start adjusting it
- highlight number with highlighter
- scroll up or up arrow increases the number
- selecting out of number bounding box (highlighted) exits this mode
- also place four small buttons (not big like current ones) to do same thing
- alternatively, bind keyboard shortcuts to mins+, mins-, secs+, secs-
** DONE footer with links, information, docs, keyboard shortcuts, etc
CLOSED: [2021-11-10 Wed 12:23]
** TODO add more keyboard shortcuts
** TODO update query parameters when settings change dynamically
** DONE rename flip - > 'count up', 'count down'
CLOSED: [2021-11-10 Wed 12:15]
** TODO be defensive - enforce min and max time
(max: 23h, 59s),with min:1s
if parameter or setting is outside bounds its quantized to fit in bounds
** TODO tick up, tick down animation when timer changes
i want to see the number 'roll' up or 'roll' down in response
** HOLD hot reloading
it's frustrating to recompile every time! i just want it to work! 
fix upstream
may have a better place in some sort of web framework module instead
